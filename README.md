# latinNAO
Project of Fundamental of AI in which NAO robot will dance following a  choreography

This project has got the following goals:

1) To stimulate the comprehension and
   the discussion regarding the basic
   algorithm for planning, in the context of
   AI discipline   
2) To test your skill on a fun and intuitive
   case study: the humanoid NAO robot
3) To devise techniques for automatic and creative generation of
   complex movements in robots, such as choreographies
   
And the rules are:

1) Each group must plan a choreography (sequence of
   positions) given a problem description
2) Each group must choose a music suitable for the
   choreography (by respecting the total time limit of 3 minutes)
   and test it on the virtual NAO (using Choregraphe)
3) A day of voting will then take place (during the last lectures)
   in which the winning choreography will be decided,
   considered the most satisfying from the artistic point of view
